# VulnAssesor
>[!warning]
> **Work in Progress:** This project is in the very early stages of development. It is not yet functional and is subject to major changes.

## 🚀 The Goal

**VulnAssesor** is being built to be an open-source, all-in-one web security and monitoring hub.

The primary goal is to create a service where a user can sign in, add their website, and get a complete, easy-to-understand security analysis.

The **key feature** will be the integration of AI to analyze any vulnerability found, explain the risk in plain English in a well formatted report, and provide specific, code-level fixes.

## ✨ Planned Features

* **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Scan source code for vulnerabilities.
* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):** Scan live, running websites for weaknesses.
* **Targeted Scanning:** Run fast, custom scans using Nuclei templates.
* **Monitoring:** Continuous 24/7 uptime and security status checks.

## 💻 Core Technology

* **Backend:** Django
* **Frontend:** Django Templates + HTMX
* **Task Queuing:** Celery + Redis
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment:** Docker
